# Clock for TWGHs Wong Fut Nam College

**Description**: This project, developed for my alma mater, is an examination clock that enables users to input exam amendments using a rich text editor and display them on-screen. Built with Typescript and SvelteKit, it supports offline usage via service workers. Serving as an ad-free alternative to online stopwatches, it has been in production since 2022.

Other things to include:

  - **Technology stack**: Sveltekit with HTML, CSS, Typescript
  - **Status**:  Version 2.0, it is a complete rewrite from its ReactJS predecessor.
  - **Links to production instances**: https://www.twghwfns.edu.hk/exam/
